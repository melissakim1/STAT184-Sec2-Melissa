This data folder is meant to store all datasets used in future projects. Currently, it contains a .gitkeep file, as well as 2 CSV files titled "group_data" and "individual_data". Both these files are related to the U.S. Armed Forces Data, which contains information on the numbers of people in the U.S. military based on categories like Pay Grade, Branch, Rank Title, and Sex. The group data sorts the original Armed Forces Data by Pay Grade, while the individual data sorts the original data by each individual and their corresponding categories, with 1 row per individual. In the future, this folder will organize even more data files to ensure that anyone who clones or forks this repository has easy access.
